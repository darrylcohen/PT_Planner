## The Requirements

This was an exercise in class at General Assembly. We had to plot the stations you would go through
when traveling from Origin to Destination

## My Solution

The logic is to proceed on the train line until you get to the destination.
If the current station is a change over
  1. Find a line that will get to the destination and proceed
  2. If there is no line then proceed on current line
